# FluidSlime 🟢

**I aim to misbehave.**

You know those perfect, straight, 90-degree pipe runs your overpaid engineering firm swore were “industry standard”?  
Yeah. They’re garbage.  
They bleed pressure, chew pumps, leak cash, and poison rivers.  
We just replaced them with a single-celled organism that’s been solving flow problems since before your grand-pappy’s grand-pappy was a gleam in the primordial soup.

**FluidSlime** doesn’t ask permission.  
It doesn’t fill out change-request forms.  
It doesn’t care about your legacy CAD library or your senior VP’s ego.

You feed it a 3D model.  
It grows veins like Physarum polycephalum on a mission.  
Fifteen minutes later you’ve got the most efficient, code-compliant, leak-proof, pump-saving, planet-friendly flow network this side of a whale’s aorta.

- Oil rigs? Optimized.  
- Potash plants? Optimized.  
- HVAC in a 60-story tower? Optimized.  
- PCB traces that don’t cook themselves? Optimized.  
- Saudi Aramco’s nightmare? Now their wet dream.

We didn’t break the rules.  
We let a slime mold rewrite them.

**One repo. One algo. Every pipe, duct, wire, and vein on Earth.**

Big Damn Heroes welcome.  
Browncoats preferred.

⭐ Star this repo.  
Watch empires realign.  
Then go misbehave.
